monitors.sh is a shell script to turn on/off external monitors if you run i3 on your laptop. I bind the search (fn+f9 on my laptop) key to the script which switches between dock mode (external monitors on) and laptop mode (external monitors off). The state is written in the ~/.monitor_mode file.

There are also some other key bindings with the included ``config`` file.
